    <div class="head1">About</div>
    Tangram is an object-relational mapper. In other words, it lets you store objects in a conventional relational database, as if it were an object-oriented database. The original authors of Tangram are <a href="http://www.soundobjectlogic.com">Sound Object Logic</a>.
    <p></p>

    <div class="head1">Who we are</div>
    A group of Tangram users, lead by Sam Vilain, author of the successful Class::Tangram module which can be found on <a href="http://www.cpan.org">CPAN</a>.  Although we are not affiliated with <a href="http://www.soundobjectlogic.com">Sound Object Logic</a> we intend to work closely with them as their experience and achievements are highly respected.

    <div class="head1">The current status of Tangram and our intentions</div>
    After a recent post by <a href="giorgos at perlfect.com">myself</a> to the Tangram-users mailing list enquiring about the status of Tangram it emerged that even though there is a user base for Tangram, the module isn't actively maintained by its original authors, <a href="http://www.soundobjectlogic.com">Sound Object Logic</a>. This is for a variety of reasons including their shift of focus to developing the next generation Tangram; code-named "T3". If you wish you may read the <a href="jllreply.html">full reply of Jean-Louis Leroy</a> from Sound Object Logic about this issue.
    <p></p>
    The main difference between T3 and T2 (the Tangram we currently use) is the former's current lack of support for RDBMS storage. This, combined with the fact that T2 has already been used by many of us lead to the decision to attempt to resurrect it. However, we don't see T2 and T3 as competing products; we'd rather see one aiding the development of the other.
    <p></p>
    
    <div class="head1">Our plan</div>
    After a brief discussion on the mailing list we decided that our efforts should focus on:
    <ul>
      <li>Refactoring and internal documentation of the existing T2 classes</li>
      <li>Implementation of new features including but not limited to:
         <ul>
	   <li>truly symmetric back-references - so that two attributes that are exact opposites of each other can be accessed from either direction
           <li>Tangram::IntrHash completion
	   <li>Tangram::ixHash - an ordered hash which can behave like an array or a hash
	   <li>more basic data types (enumerated values, booleans, sets, etc)
	   <li>indexing support in the schema
	   <li>alternative id allocation strategies
	   <li>result set paging
	   <li>schema evolution
	 </ul>

      <li>Engineering a sound migration path for T2 users to move to
        T3 once it is ready.
    </ul>
    
    Of course our strategy is still in its very early stages.
