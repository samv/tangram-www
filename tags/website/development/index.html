    <div class="head1">How to Participate in Tangram development</div>
    
    The best starting point is joining the mailing list. The are two ways:
    <ul>
      <li>Visit <a href="http://www.perlfect.com/mailman/listinfo/tangram-t2-maintainers">http://www.perlfect.com/mailman/listinfo/tangram-t2-maintainers</a></li>
      <li>Send a message to <a href="mailto:tangram-t2-maintainers-request@perlfect.com">tangram-t2-maintainers-request@perlfect.com</a> with "subscribe" as the subject of the message</li>
    </ul>

    Apart from that feel free to <a href="/download">checkout the CVS sources</a> and have a go at them.
    <p></p>

    <div class="head1">Tangram bugs and enhancements</div>
    If you have discovered a bug or made changes that you would like to share then please file a bug report by sending an email to <a href="mailto:bug-Tangram@rt.cpan.org">bug-Tangram@rt.cpan.org</a>. Before sending the report you may want to <a href="http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bugs.html?Dist=Tangram">check the bugs that have been filed</a> already to see if your bug is already there; if it's not then proceed to notify us. We are mostly interested in:
    <ul>
      <li>obscure error messages from Tangram internals when given bad input
        (that are currently perplexing you - the longer term input marshalling
        work will eventually clear up all of these);
      </li>
      <li>situations where Tangram demonstrates any behaviour you think is odd;</li>
      <li>any changes you have had to make to Tangram to get it to work for you; patches, etc.;</li>
      <li>any new Tangram::Type's that you think are useful or want to share;</li>
      <li>even ... wishlist items (though of course, no guarantees).</li>
    </ul>
    
    The more detailed the report, the better we will able to work on it.  The best 
    thing is a small test fragment demonstrating the fault; but, a bad bug 
    report is better than no bug report, so submit it! If you can, see if the 
    <a href="/download">Tangram 2.05pre1 pre-release</a> fixes your problem; but the more error 
    message texts are in RT, the more likely they are to be found in Google.
