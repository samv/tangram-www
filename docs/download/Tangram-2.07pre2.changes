   - replaced @ISA with 'use base'
   - replaced default typetags with automounting
   - prefetch now takes either class or remote
   - implemented prefetch for IntrArray and IntrSet
      *::prefetch still need real-life testing,
      especially when class(coll) <> class(item)

1.00  Nov 07 1999 - first mature release version
	- deploy() now also works directly on DBI handles
	- deploy() allows specification of SQL types via the schema hash

	- as a consequence Tangram should now work with PostgreSql
	- fixed bug: erase() failed in presence of stateless leaf classes

	  cannot handle them; those modules are still present though

2.05pre1 May 2003 - SamV - first "not the momma" release

	- Patches from lots of people, don't know who 'coz the honourable
	  grand master JLL applied a lot of them, I'll try to summarize
	  here:
	
		- back-porting pieces for 5.00503 (that was me)
		- a more elegant solution for the
		  Tangram::AbstractArray/AbstractHash corner case than
		  the one I submitted :-)
		- code that (possibly) completes Tangram::Hash support (I
		  haven't written a test case to confirm this yet)
		- A fix to Tangram::AbstractSet that again caters to some
		  very strange corner cases (this was me too)
		- Working implementation of the Tangram::DMDateTime type
		  mapping, a good thing that running a persistent
		  application server offsets the huge time it takes to
		  load in Date::Manip :-)
		- A bug fix to Tangram::FlatArray mapping type that
		  affects deleting members (don't know whose)
		- Tangram::IntrSet::get_intrusions (? can anyone claim
		  or explain this one?)
		- Minor Tangram::PerlDump fix (a simple one)
		- Deep, deep magic in Tangram::Relational::Engine;
		  new function get_heterogeneity (anyone?)
		- Use of uninitialised variable in Tangram::Engine...
		- Other large changes to Tangram::Schema (? - get_bases,
		  get_specs, is_root, etc)
		- A problem with merging schemas when you used a
		  `back-ref' to a class that is later on in the schema
		  (me)
		- Scattered showers of changes in Tangram::Storage
		  (get_insert_statements etc, lots of `off by one'
		  (reference nesting level that is) changes)
	
	- All I can say is that there have been some very smart people
	  looking at this code and submitting patches.

2.05pre2 Jun 2003 - SamV
	- Minor Tangram::Expr defined vs logically-false fix
	  (Aaron Mackey)
	- explicitly select all ORDER BY columns (Aaron Mackey)
	- normalise default "slot" and "coll" column names in
	  Tangram::Intr* types (SamV)

2.05 Jul 2003 - SamV
	- Tangram::Scalar and Tangram::Ref column names are now passed
	  through $schema->{normalize}->()

2.06 Jul 17 2003 - SamV
	- Added $storage->oid_isa($oid, "ClassName") method for
	  marshalling OIDs
	- Fixed minor bugs causing test suite to issue large warnings
	  on 5.8.1-RC2

2.07 Sep 1 2003 - SamV
	- Fixed bug with Tangram::Intr* and erasing objects that
	  referred to a class which didn't use their class name as
	  their table name [closes: 2650]
	- Added the ability to use limit => [ N, Y ] in
	  Tangram::Storage->select statements
	- Added Tangram::Coll::includes_or; see the man page for
	  Tangram::Expr
	- Enhancement of error message from
	  Tangram::Relational::Engine [related to 2631]
	- Support for using table types via $schema->{sql}{table_type}
	- Support for sub-selects with MySQL, for the one test that
	  uses them.  Also $storage->{no_subselects} is auto-detected.
	- Completed $storage->prefetch() function for all working
	  types, new test t/prefetch.t
	- If you have NULL values in array or hash slots in your
	  database, then it won't cause a hard error, except possibly
	  with prefetch() [related to 2631]
	- Various small fixes to bizarre internal error messages
	  [related to 2631]
	- Minor documentation fixes
	- Exceptions on various DB failures are now thrown when
	  DBI::execute() is called internally, rather than being
	  largely ignored.
	- Cosmetic Test Suite changes
