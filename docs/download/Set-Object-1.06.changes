Revision history for Perl extension Set::Object.

0.01  Sat Jun  6 13:36:56 1998
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.18

0.02  Sun Jul  12 1998
	- fixed refcount bug that leaked object when hash was reorganized
	- ensured compatibility with Perl 5.004_71

1.00 mid-99
	- fixed some bug (related to subsets?)
	- first mature release

1.01 8 Nov 1999
	- no longer use Perl arrays internally, now compatible with Perl 5.005_62

1.02 8 May 08 2000
	- fixed bug that miscomputed new bucket while reindexing

1.03 24 Jan 2003
	- fixed overload related bug

1.04 3 Aug 2003
	- added various functions similar to some found in Scalar::Util,
	  but with an extra one that performs a function that lays some
	  groundwork for Container::Object (ish_int).

	  Some of these functions were in the XS code anyway, and they
	  are extremely small, so I didn't see a problem with
	  duplicating them - saves an extra dependancy.  Plus, Graham
	  Barr won't let me put ish_int or is_key in his module.

	  Knowing that they are available will also assist in fixing
	  some longer standing bugs in Tangram (eg, using $obj + 0 to
	  get a unique ID when refaddr($obj) would be better)

	- lots more input marshalling; if you ever end up doing funny
	  things to a Set::Object, then at least now you'll get a
	  clearer error message.

	- more tests; Devel::Cover test coverage now at 91% (stmt),
	  67% (branch)

	- erroneously putting scalars into Set::Objects now no longer
	  dumps core.

	- serialisation of Set::Object objects is now possible via the
	  Storable module (Data::Dumper still does the wrong thing,
	  but there is nothing I can do about that).

1.05 5 Jan 2004
	- some segfault fixes with Storable and Perl 5.6.1 (Perl 5.8.1
	  should be OK)

1.06 1 May 2004
	- Fixed segfault when attempting to remove items from an empty
	  set (fix from Richard Sterling Cox)
