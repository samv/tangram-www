Class::Tangram version 1.11
===========================

Class::Tangram serves to provide a base class for deriving Tangram
objects from.

In some ways, it is similar to Class::Contract, but it allows
finer-grained specification of the types of attributes.  This is
particularly useful if you are using Tangram, but consider it an
"alternate approach" to Class::Contract, that supports persistence
without using Data::Dumper/Storable.

If you want to know what this is all about, first go to Sound Object
Logic's web site at http://www.tangram-persistence.org/, and read the
"Guided Tour" of Tangram.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires Set::Object 1.02 or higher, and Pod::Constants
0.12.  You may also want to install Tangram 2.03 or later.

Test::Simple 0.18 and Date::Manip 0.32 is also required to run the
test suite.

UPGRADING FROM 1.09

There is only a very minor source incompatible change, that would
affect people who used tied values for their init_default attribute
options.  ie, it should not affect anyone.  e-mail me if the new
behaviour is not what you want!

UPGRADING FROM 1.08

There are no source incompatibility changes since 1.08.

UPGRADING FROM 1.07

There are no backwards-incompatibile changes in this release, unless
you have another Tangram::Type that provides the tangram type
"transient".

UPGRADING FROM 1.06

Most users should be able to install the new version without problems.

However, there are a few small places where slight changes could
affect your code.

   1. If you have an attribute that is an array or a flat array, and
      you evaluate it in list context, it now returns the contents of
      the array rather than a reference to the array.  This is keeping
      in line with the way Set::Object attributes work.

   2. If you were using the bogus "time" or "timestamp" types, you
      will need to switch to "rawtime", "rawdatetime" or "dmdatetime".
