Tangram is an object-relational mapper. It makes objects persist in
relational databases, and provides powerful facilities for retrieving
and filtering them. Tangram fully supports object-oriented programming,
including polymorphism, multiple inheritance and collections.
It does so in an orthogonal fashion, that is, it doesn't require
your classes to implement support functions nor inherit from a utility class.

Tangram builds upon DBI, so you'll need to install DBI and at least
one DBD driver if that is not done already. You will also need
Set::Object. These modules are available from CPAN.

If you intend to run the regression tests (recommended), you will
also need to prepare an empty database before starting the installation
procedure.
