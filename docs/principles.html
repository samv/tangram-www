<div class="head1">Object Orientation Principles / Best Practices</div>

<p>Whilst the vary to which these principles are supported by
different languages vary, there are a certain set of principles to the
OO paradigm which I hope to 'encapsulate' here.  This page largely
serves as a definition of terms and may be refered to from other
documentation.</p>

<!-- Pass messages, via method calls
Objects - Classes, Instances
Generalisation and Specialisation, via Inheritance
Polymorphism
Relationships - Composition, Aggregation, Association
Reflection
Encapsulate and hide properties

Seperate Interface from Implementation (abstraction)
Functional modeling rather than System-centric coding
Resilience in the face of change & expansion of scope
Grace

  <dt>Encapsulation</dt>

  <dd>The attributes and services/behaviors are encapsulated in a
    class.  No direct access of an object's properties happens from
    outside the code associated with that class.</dd>

  <dt>Information Hiding</dt>

  <dd>The information that an object uses to drive its implementation
    are not visible from the "outside".  This is usually not enforced
    with Perl.</dd>

  <dd>Certain attributes and services may be internal to the class
    (private), the package (protected), or external (public).  Again,
    these are distinctions not normally enforced in Perl.</dd>

  <dt>Message Passing</dt>

  <dd>Objects communicate by invoking services from other objects,
    passing the required information for the service.  This means that
    even if an operation is thought to be happening between two
    objects of the same type, they must still communicate with each
    other through their "formal" interface.</dd>

  <dd>An Object Oriented Surgeon would hand you a scalpel and say,
    “Now perform this operation on yourself!”.</dd>

  <dt>Late Binding</dt>

  <dd>An object is not linked to it's behaviors until run-time.  This
    is important for polymorphism.  In Perl 5, all method lookups are
    always bound (or verified) at run time.

  <dt>Delegation</dt>

  <dd>Objects may pass work on to other objects and behave as those
    delegated objects.</dt>

  <dt>Class/Instance/Object</dt>

  <dd>All <em>objects</em> are <em>instances</em> of a <em>class</em>.
    Objects which are similar enough to share the same implementation
    of methods are usually considered to share a common class, or be
    of the same "type".</dd>

  <dd>This is not a hard and fast rule; it may also be possible for
    individual objects to be able to behave as two classes of object
    simultaneously.  This is commonly called a <em>mix-in</em>, and
    the varieties of levels of this are called <em>Roles</em> in Perl
    6.  However, this functionality is only syntactically different
    from <em>delegation</em>.</dd>

  <dt>Generalization/Specialization without Polymorphism</dt>

  <dd>Classes may inherit attributes and services from another class,
    and behave exactly as the parent class.  The test for this is
    called the <em>empty sub-class test</em>, where a new class is
    created that is a degenerately void specialisation of the parent
    class.  The object should still behave exactly as if it were a
    member of the parent type.</dd>

  <dt>Generalization/Specialization with Polymorphism</dt>

  <dd>A class may override methods inherited from a
    <em>superclass</em>.  Polymorphism allows the language to call the
    correct method in the hierarchy.  As well as polymorphism, there
    must be some method of calling <em>superclass methods</em>, so
    that you can augment, and not merely replace functionality.</dd>

  <dd>
    </dd>

  <dt>Relationships (or Associations)</dt>

  <dd>An object may be composed of other objects, which determine how
    it behaves. For example, a car is composed of body, engine,
    suspension, etc.; and these in turn are also composed of simpler
    objects.  The major commonly recognised forms of relationships are
    <em>associations</em>, <em>aggregations</em> and
    <em>compositions</em>.  The differences between them may appear to
    be minor, but a clear distinction between them whilst designing
    programs can be useful.</dd>

  <dt>Interface/Implementation</dt>

  <dd>An object may be of a type declared by an <em>interface</em>.
    That is, it does not provide an implementation that may be
    sub-classed; it simply prescribes a set of operations and they
    must be fully <em>implemented</em> by the provider of the
    interface.</dd>

  <dt>Generalization/Specialization of Interfaces</dt>

  <dd>A class may implement the methods of multiple interfaces at
    once.  These interfaces should not place any undue restrictions on
    other specialization that the object may perform.</dd>

  <dt>Reflection (aka Run-Time Type Information)</dt>

  <dd>Each object knows the details about which class or interface of
    which it is a member.  This is sometimes called “Run Time Type
    Inspection”, and is possible to do with Class::Tangram - in fact,
    this is used extensively in the interactive T2 schema browser.</dd>

  <dt>Multithreading</dt>

  <dd>Each object can have multiple concurrent execution paths.  In
    practice, this means keeping all state information about what you
    are doing with an object on the stack (as the stack is never
    shared between threads), and committing changes back to the object
    in a "safe" fashion - that is, never leaving the object in a state
    where another thread reading the object might get confused.</dd>
