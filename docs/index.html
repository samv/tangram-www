  <div class="head1">What is Tangram?</div>

    <div class="right figure" style="width: 235px">
      <a href="http://www.tangrams.ca/puzzles/puzzles.htm">
        <img src="gfx/tangram1.png" border="0" />
      </a>
      <p class="caption">Each piece of the Qi Qiao Tu (Seven Ingenious
       Plan, or Tangram) is a combination of multiple copies of the
       smallest piece.</p> </div>

    <p>In the ancient Chinese puzzle of Qiqiaotu, seven pieces are
       arranged to try to form a specific shape.  Each piece is
       simple, yet as they fit together seamlessly the scope for
       different configurations is endless.</p>

    <p>Tangram provides for your <a
       href="http://www.perl.org/">Perl</a> programs the basic pieces
       that allow you to take a program model - such as a UML or
       Entity Relationship diagram - and convert it directly to a
       <em><a href="docs/Tangram/Schema.html">Tangram
       Schema</a></em>.  Interfaces have been written to allow a more
       rapid development of data models, similar to the <a
       href="http://www.alzabo.org/">Alzabo</a> data modeller.
       </p>

    <p>Once you have this schema, you can easily create
      <em>transaction-savvy</em> applications that can perform
      <em>complex queries</em> on your data base, <em>without directly
      coding SQL</em>.  Advanced <em>demand loading</em><a
      href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a> combined with a superb <em>data
      caching model</em><a
      href="#fn2"><sup>2</sup></a> removes the need for a fantastic proportion
      of queries in a typical program.
    </p>

    <div class="head2">Tangram implements Orthogonal Object
      Persistence to Relational Databases</div>

    <p>That term might not make much sense to a lot of people - no
      doubt including people who have been programming for decades -
      so your first reaction might be, "Oh, no, another Object
      Orientated Loony!  Please <tt>$self->fornicate</tt>".  If that is your
      reaction, perhaps one of the other similar tools mentioned on
      this page will be more your style.</p>

    <p>To explain it piece by piece - <b>Object Persistence</b> in
      this context, means taking Perl objects and saving them
      somewhere.  Lots of tools on CPAN will do that for you, from
      humble serializers like <a
      href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Storable">Storable</a> or <a
      href="http://www.yaml.org/">YAML</a>, to more
      structured solutions like <a
      href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/MLDBM">MLDBM</a> or <a
      href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Pixie">Pixie</a>.

    <p><b>Orthogonal</b> (literally “at a tangent to”) means that the
      tool itself does not <em>intrude on the application</em>, such
      as by requiring all stored objects to have a <em>common base
      class</em>, associating <em>storage-related information</em> in
      the (user-visible) data structure or requiring the objects to
      <em>conform to an interface</em> by implementing special
      methods.  Very few CPAN modules that implement forms of object
      persistence are truly orthogonal.

    <p>Whilst Tangram itself is orthogonal, a companion module <a
      href="docs/Class/Tangram.html">Class::Tangram</a>
      exists that makes Perl classes from entire Tangram Schemas (via
      <a href="docs/Class/Tangram/Generator.html">Class::Tangram::Generator)</a>
      or portions of schema and give you fully customisable packages
      and DWIM accessors for your data structure.  Class::Tangram
      has been designed to honour various <a href="principles.html">Object Orientation principles</a>.</p>

    <p><b>Relational Databases</b> are the predominant storage systems
      used and taught throughout the advanced programming world.  They
      are distinctly different from <em>heirarchical</em> databases,
      such as file systems, in that they are based on <em>Set
      Theory</em>.  Some understanding of set theory, or experience
      with relational databases is beneficial but not essential for
      using Tangram.</p>

    <div class="head1">What Tangram is not</div>

    <p>Tangram does not provide <b>Storage Objects</b>.  That is, the
      programming style where every action performed on an object will
      immediately be updated in the open database transaction, perhaps
      after calling a “store” method.  This is a complementary
      approach to Tangram - and a very simple and effective technique,
      used by modules such as <a
      href="http://www.class-dbi.com/cgi-bin/wiki/index.cgi?HomePage">Class::DBI</a>
      or <a
      href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Class-Persist/">Class::Persist</a><a href="#fn3"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>

    <p>Tangram can not (always) be used to <b>retro-actively fit a
      database</b> in the way that Alzabo or Class::DBI can.  If you
      are able to accomodate minor schema additions to the original
      database, and certain conditions are met, it can be possible to
      engineer a Tangram Schema that maps to a desired database
      structure - but this is not the design intent of Tangram, and
      you will be missing out on a lot of features.
      </p>

    <p>The current version of Tangram is <b>not lightweight</b>.  The
      focus has never been on optimising for Perl-side performance,
      but more for schema flexibility and <em>enabling you to
      write</em> database efficient programs.  No library can really
      put trainer wheels on the open-ended nature of data structure
      design.

    <p>For long-running applications such as OLTP (eg, web
      applications), this is generally a good thing, however there are
      applications that would be unncecessarily slowed by using
      Tangram over using DBI directly.  This may change when Tangram
      is refactored to T2.  Don't you just hate it when software
      projects go the same way as movie sequels?  The same mentality
      that brought you, <tt>$hollywood_blockbuster</tt> now brings you
      <tt>$hollywood_blockbuster[1]</tt>.  But nobody stopped to
      think, “hey, guys, what do you think the cinematography was like
      on that one, don't you think we wrote the lead characters to be
      a bit stock, dead and lifeless?  Maybe we should fire the sound
      engineer who kept repeating all that patriotic fanfare during
      the fight scenes, you know maybe that portraying the American
      Dream Perpetuating along with scenes of gooks dying, good guys
      winning and people being mutilated with Hot Irons would be so
      ... very ... ironic?”.  In the words of the late William
      S. Burroughs<a href="#fn4"><sup>4</sup></a> - "Hollywood will
      get what it deserves: time."</p>

    <p>But I digress.  Rest assured that T2 is not going to be a badly
      done sequel.  See, I haven't even bumped the version number, it
      can't be getting new, improved, etc.  It will be Tangram 2
      <em>refined</em>.

    <div class="head1">Getting Started</div>

    <p>There is extensive <a href="docs/index.html">documentation</a> for Tangram, including
      tutorials and (soon!) example schemas and applications.  There
      is also a relatively low volume <a href="lists/t2-users">mailing list</a>.  You can get the latest
      version of Tangram from <a
      href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Tangram/">search.cpan.org</a>,
      the <a href="download/index.html">downloads section</a>
      of this web site, or directly from the <a href="development/index.html#svn">tangram.utsl.gen.nz Subversion
      repository</a>.</p>

  <ol>

     <li class="footnote"><a name="fn1"></a>
	Demand loading is the normal RAD way of building apps, but
pre-caching facilities are also available for those situations where
you need it.
     </li>

     <li class="footnote"><a name="fn2"></a>
	All objects are cached, but there is an easy way to dump the cache -
so you can start each database transaction free of “dirty read”
related problems.
     </li>

     <li class="footnote"><a name="fn3"></a>
	Class::Persist perhaps doesn't fit cleanly into this category, but
then trying to categorise programming libraries into hard and fast
categories is a mistake in the first place.  I put it in this category
primarily because the data source (connection) and package are tightly
bound.
     </li>

     <li class="footnote"><a name="fn4"></a>
	Or maybe it was Kerouac or even the (not so late) Hunter S. Thompson.
I picked up the quote from a live performance featuring writings from
these authors.
