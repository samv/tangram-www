    <div class="head1">Our plan</div>
    After a brief discussion on the mailing list we decided that our efforts should focus on:
    <ul>
      <li>Refactoring and internal documentation of the existing T2 classes</li>
      <li>Implementation of new features including but not limited to:
         <ul>
	   <li>truly symmetric back-references - so that two attributes that are exact opposites of each other can be accessed from either direction
           <li>Tangram::IntrHash completion
	   <li>Tangram::ixHash - an ordered hash which can behave like an array or a hash
	   <li>more basic data types (enumerated values, booleans, sets, etc)
	   <li>indexing support in the schema
	   <li>alternative id allocation strategies
	   <li>result set paging
	   <li>schema evolution
	 </ul>

      <li>Engineering a sound migration path for T2 users to move to
        T3 once it is ready.
    </ul>
    
    Of course our strategy is still in its very early stages.
    <p></p>
