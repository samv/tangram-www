    <p>In the below e-mail, Jean-Louis Leroy, the original author of
    Tangram, explains his long-term vision for Tangram
    3.  (the <b>bold</b> sections are my emphasis - Sam)</p>

Ok, here I am at last.

It's true that I haven't been very present recently, and the concerns
about the status and further development of Tangram are
legitimate. So, in this (long) post I'll try to give a correct picture
of our plans wrt Tangram; that will include a description of the kind
of company SOL is, what we've been busying ourselves with, etc.

SOL is a small company. There are four of us, all partners, and
currently we have no employees. We spend most of our time working as
contractors. Currently three of us work for <b>Eurocontrol, the agency
responsible for managing the airspace of 31 european countries</b>.

We don't see ourselves as a pool of mercenaries though. We are all
technology obsessed people, we believe that we have quality answers to
recurring problems in software development, and we want to promote
them. In that respect, SOL is a true company, with objectives of its
own, and not a mere aggregation of individuals. We're ready to invest
- time and money - in projects we believe in, but only within our
sustainable capacities. We don't have any external investors, by
choice if anything else. The time spent writing this long post will
reduce by a little bit what the four of us can spend next month on
pizza and beer ;-)

The Tangram you use, we call it 'T2'. It's an object-relational mapper
written in Perl. Some of you probably remember me talking about T2's
successor, <b>T3, which is a multi-language approach to object
persistence in multiple media (relational database, XML, etc) and,
more generally, is a tool for generic object manipulation</b>.

We haven't paid much attention to T2 because we've barely used it in
these recent years. I've implemented a couple of CGI websites in which
I've used Tangram, and it worked well enough for me these times; I'm
*very* pleased to hear that it does for most of you too, most of the
time.

We made very little direct cash with Tangram, and no benefit at all,
at least from an accountant's point of view. We had a couple (like in
'2') of requests for commercial licenses, and it would have cost us a
lot more to hire the legal support to write them down than dozens of
license sales would have secured. We sold one support contract.

Mind you, we're not bitter about it. We see ourselves as craftsmen,
not sellers of boxed software like that guy in Redmond ;-)

Currently we've dropped the entire idea/hope/illusion of making euros
or dollars with our open-source software. OTOH we still firmly believe
that 'the community' can offer us a lot, not in cash, but in field
testing and code contributions.

Ok, forward.

Frankly, for us, T2 is a thing from the past. We don't plan to invest
any more time, effort or money in it, beyond the microscopic. We'd be
glad to transfer the responsibility of maintaining T2 to someone
else. We don't see that as a 'fork' - it would be a one-sprong fork
indeed...It would be nice if the maintainance effort was made via our
SourceForge account, and if the filiation between T2 and SOL remained
evident. For the least, this is likely to help us bring T3 to
achievement. That being said, we acknowledge the right for anybody to
fork any piece of GPL code, anytime.

<b>Our focus is now on T3.</b>

<b>The famed T3 is no science fiction at all. It's used everyday at
Eurocontrol, and that usage is spreading. We use it to exchange and
massage *complex* data between C++, Java and Perl.</b> InCASE - a
Tangram-based universal object GUI written in Java - is used to
visualize and edit test data for crucial software at Eurocontrol.

Up to now, the development of T3 has been driven by the needs of our
only Tangram paying client - Eurocontrol. <b>We have XML and binary and
text dump and diff backends in all three languages</b>. We don't have a
relational backend yet because they use a commercial, proprietary
product.

Recently there's been an exciting development: <b>last year we applied
for a R&amp;D subvention from the Brussels Region - and we got it!</b> We
committed to developing the T3 architecture in the three
aforementioned languages, plus the XML *and* relational backends, plus
some cross-language development and testing tools. The Region funds
60% of the effort. We seek other means of financing, and we're ready
to hurt our wallet a bit ;-)

The subvention includes funds for writing papers, going to
conferences, etc.

Yes T3 is an open-source project. That's in the agreement with the
Region. While in the beginning T3 is more of a Cathedral project, I do
see a lot of room for some Bazaar. For example, my command of
automake/autoconf is nil; someone wants to help? Tomorrow I need some
sort of ODBC in C++ on Linux, sure I've heard that it exists, but
where, are there several contenders, which one is best, etc? T3 will
support multiple backends, we want many of them, feel like cranking
yours? What about two new mailing lists: tangram-t2-maintainers and
tangram-t3-dev? The first one will be that new guy's turf, and Jacques
and Pascal and Yves and I will be present and active and listening on
the latter.

Talked a lot. Listening now...
